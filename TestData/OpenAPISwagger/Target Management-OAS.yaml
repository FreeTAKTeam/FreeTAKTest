    Target:
      description: >-
        The CARVER Target is used in the planning and decision-making phases of operations. Analysts assign scores to each criterion, often on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5), and sum these scores to prioritize targets. Higher total scores indicate more vulnerable targets. This structured approach helps ensure that resources are allocated effectively and strategic objectives are achieved efficiently.
