      The Data Sync / Mission API provides the capability in TAK Server for
      clients, such as ATAK,  

      to share collections of information which are tracked as part of missions.
      Once a mission has  

      been created by a client, it immediately becomes available to other
      clients (Assuming they have the plugin).


      A substantial portion the API and related functions have been developed in
      order to provide clients with the ability to add and remove relevant
      mission content, determine what changes to missions have been done by
      other clients, and then request updates for only what each client
      requires. In this way, each client can always maintain a consistent local
      view of missions and their contents, which conserving resources such as
      local storage and network bandwidth.


      There are several types of content that can be associated with a mission:


      - **CoT tracks**: CoT tracks are referenced by their UID, so that any
      information that can be  
          represented in a mission. Once CoT UIDs have been added to a mission, the server can then  
          provide the client with the latest CoT event associated with each UID
      - **enterprise sync resources**: Files can be uploaded to TAK Server
      through the Enterprise Sync API. The adds generality such that any type of
      file that is useful from a client perspective can be added to a mission.  
          Common files types include GRGs, images, and KML (Keyhole markup language) files. These  
          resources are referenced by calculating a deterministic hash for each file, based on the binary  
          contents of the file. Once the association has been made between a mission and a file, the  
          file contents of the mission can be searched by parameters including time interval and  
          geographic location.
      - **Check Lists:** requires the ExChecks plugin installed. Allow the
      collaborative execution of a series of tasks

      - **mission logs**: Mission Logs are a series of free-form text entries
      that can be viewed individually or as a complete log.
          

      In addition to CoT tracks and files, each mission can also contain a
      "Mission Log" (also referred to as a "Recce Log"). Mission logs are
      composed of individual log entries, which clients post to the server. Once
      a log entry has been added, it immediately becomes available as part of
      the mission log, in a similar fashion to enterprise sync resources and CoT
      tracks. CoT UIDs and file resources can also be associated with individual
      log entries,  

      just as they can be associated with missions. Log entries may also be
      updated and deleted.  

      Similarly, tracks and files can also be removed from the mission. Every
      change to the state of a mission, including the creation or deletion of
      the mission itself, is tracked by TAK Server. Based on this information,
      the server can generate a change log detailing each change to the mission
      over time. This log can be filtered based on an arbitrary time interval.  

      Clients may subscribe to one or more missions. Once a client has
      subscribed to a mission, the server will send it a CoT message informing
      the client of each change. Based on this notification, the client can then
      request a change log for an appropriate time range.

      Mission Logs (Recce Logs) are composed of free-form text entries which can
      be associated  

      with one or more missions. Log entries can be created, read, updated,
      deleted. The  

      complete log for a mission may also be downloaded, consisting of all log
      entries for the  

      mission.

        ### postGeoObject


        - verb: POST

        - endPoint: /ManageGeoObject/postGeoObject

        - returns: UID
            

        #### Parameters


        - GeoObject: It's the information that will determine which type will be
        placed on the tak maps including his icon. Please see API documentation
        for a list of valid entries. Since 1.7 you can also use nicknames for
        the geo objects.

        - longitude: OPTIONAL the angular distance of the geoobject from the
        meridian of the greenwich, UK expressed in positive or negative float.
        (e.g -76.107.7998). Remember to set the display of your TAK in decimal
        coordinates, where _West 77.08_ is equal to '-77.08' in the API.

        - latitude: OPTIONAL the angular distance of the geoobject from the
        earths equator expressed in positive or negative float. (e.g 43.855682).

        - how: the way in which this geo information has been acquired. Please
        see API documentation for a list of valid entries.

        - attitude: OPTIONAL the kind of expected behavior of the GeoObject (e.g
        friendly, hostile, unknown). Please see API documentation for a list of
        valid entries.

        - name: a string to ID the GeoObject on a map.

        - bearing: OPTIONAL since 1.7, the direction expressed in degrees
        (1-360). Default: 0.

        - distance: OPTIONAL since 1.7, the distance in meters from the Lat/long
        or address.

        - timeout: OPTIONAL the length, expressed in seconds until the point
        will stale out. Default is 300 seconds or 5 minutes.

        - uid: optional input parameter, need to be an Unique Id for this
        element, if not present will be server generated, if sent ATAK will try
        to update an existing geoObject. Use `putGeoObject` instead

        - address: OPTIONAL address of destination. If sent will try to solve
        the exact geolocation of the destination. Possible valid examples are:
            - Big Arkansas River Park, Wichita, KS, USA
            - Wichita, KS, USA
            - Big Arkansas River Park, Wichita
            - and so on.

      description: >-
        This API endpoint is used to retrieve the status of a checklist. It
        makes an HTTP GET request to the specified URL with the checklist UID
        and token as query parameters.


        The response for this request will be an HTML document containing the
        checklist information. The document will include the checklist name,
        progress, and a table displaying the pending tasks. The progress is
        represented as a fraction, with the numerator indicating the number of
        completed tasks and the denominator indicating the total number of
        tasks.


        if we've got a token, find the corresponding missionChange and
        checklistTask, and recreate the checklist at the time of the change


        Here are some examples of the response for this request:


        Example 1:


        ```

        Checklist : MI IV Weaponization

        Progress : 3/12

        The following task is now Pending:

        | Name           | Description    | Due Relative DTG |

        |----------------|----------------|------------------|

        | Install ...    | Install ...    |                  |

         ```

        Example 2:


        ```

        Checklist : MI IV Weaponization

        Progress : 3/12

         ```

        Please note that the response will be in HTML format, and the content
        will be rendered as per the HTML tags used in the response.


        To make this request, you need to provide the checklist UID and token as
        query parameters in the URL.


        Example Request:


        ```

        GET

        Create a mission with the specified name.

        significant addition of the **id**, which is a pseudo-random 128-bit
        identifier assigned by the server at entry creation time, and
        "servertime" - the server-side timestamp at creation time

        equator expressed in positive or negative float. (e.g 43.855682).

        - uid: OPTIONAL input parameter, needed to update existing drone COT.

        - SPIName: the name of the Sensor Point of Interest the UAS is currently
        aiming to. currently will NOT work in a update message (when you send
        the UID).

        - SPILongitude: longitude of target. currently will NOT work in a update
        message (when you send the UID).
